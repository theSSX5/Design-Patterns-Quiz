# Design-Patterns-Quiz

This project demonstrates three design patterns in Java:

1. **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures a class has only one instance.
2. **Adapter Pattern**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
3. **Observer Pattern**: Notifies multiple objects about changes in another object.

## Explanation of Patterns

### Singleton Pattern
- **Problem**: You need only one instance of a class.
- **Solution**: The `Singleton` pattern ensures that only one instance of a class is created and provides a global point of access to it.

### Adapter Pattern
- **Problem**: Different classes need to work together but have incompatible interfaces.
- **Solution**: The `Adapter` pattern allows different classes to communicate by adapting one interface to another, making them compatible.

### Observer Pattern
- **Problem**: You need to notify multiple objects when one object changes.
- **Solution**: The `Observer` pattern provides a way to notify multiple observer objects automatically when the state of a subject object changes.
